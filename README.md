 ```
 or just get the [Anaconda](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/) package where Matplotlib (among other nice packages) is already installed.
 * [Quantecon](https://quanteconpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for discretizing the AR(1) process of income, which is needed for building its grid.
   ```
      pip install quantecon
   ```
